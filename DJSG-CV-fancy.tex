%\section{biography}
%	Dan Short Gianotti is an expert in water and climate feedbacks, in land-atmosphere interactions, in the coupled global water/energy/carbon cycles on land, and on the predictability of weather and climate. He has a PhD in Geography and Environment from Boston University following undergraduate training in Math and Physics and a first career in K-12 education. He uses global datasets and satellite remote sensing to answer questions about Earth System Processes and emergent patterns in hydro-climate. In his free time he explores with his two young children, shares his experiences with physical disability, and loves making music. He currently works at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
